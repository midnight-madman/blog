# Setting up another blog, will it stick around?

We've been here before 😄
Spent two days setting up a new blog instead of focusing on writing.

**BUT** there is a lot less friction to write and publish this time around.

In the new setup this blog is based on a simple workflow via [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md):
- created a new Vault just for blog posts
- added support for using raw Markdown files (.md) on top of MDX support
- using git extension for Obsidian [obsidian-git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) to write and push from editor

## Result 
I can write in the app that I use daily, review quickly and push to blog in one workflow.

Todo: write some goals in next article
