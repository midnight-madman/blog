## AI
ChatGPT and other large language models are in the big hype phase right now. I don't want to build yet another chat AI therapist or content generation tool. I'm interested in training these large capable models for specifc jobs to help knowledge workers like architects or accountants. B2B hackathon style ideas are more exciting to me than full-blown customer apps. The drawback is that I need input from experts otherwise it's just "out of the blue" ideas that are not relevant to professionals.

Opposite to the hype I'm interested in recommender systems, potentially combined with web3

## Web3
There are a few trends **I want to understand** and get to building as fast as possible:
- Zero Knowledge Proofs
- Layer 2 solutions

There are other trends like Utility NFTs and account abstraction that I'm following, but I don't have exciting ideas to build in this space, for now.

## AR
Apple is supposed to release their [AR/VR headset](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/) this year. I've used the iOS AR SDK a few years ago. The  for a toy example of image classification of content playing on TV screens. I currently don't have a specific app in mind, but want to try building something for it as early as possible.

## That's it
This post is a small reminder for myself to explore these topics in the next few months. I hope to write about my builds and failures in blog posts here.
