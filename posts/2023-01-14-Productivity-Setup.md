tl;dr: Blocking notifications and distracting websites works for me. Music that stimulates a feeling of flow and placing my phone in a different room are additional helpful steps.

## What I work on and how I arrived here
In a usual work day I write code, have video calls, write emails and prepare documents or presentations. This is common for most [knowledge workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker), so I assume my setup is relevant for you, just replace writing code with your type of deep work. 

## Setup
- Did you sleep enough? 
	- When I didn't get enough sleep, I choose less deep work or try to add a nap to my day, otherwise â†’ ðŸ˜´ not the best work will happen, but sometimes it helps to chip away at a project even on those days 
- Website blocking
	- On my Macbook I'm using the `/etc/hosts` file with entries for distracting websites that I want to block all the time. I've added my most visited news and social media sites here 

## Process
### Before starting to work
- Figure out how long this session will be
	- this helps me plan if 
- Place phone in a different room
	- I don't even have the chance to override all steps below and start doom scrolling
- Start music
	- Brain.fm or
	- Spotify Playlist with < 10 songs (usually in private mode so it doesn't mess up my other music recommendations)
- Block additional websites
	- I'm using [SelfControl.app](https://selfcontrolapp.com/) and there is a range of similar apps
	- This is useful for me to block social media and other websites that are sometimes required for work and communications, but can be distracting if everything else is blocked
- Turn on MacOS / iOS Focus Mode
	- Work mode stops notifications and selects the work homescreen on iOS so it shows only the smallest selection of relevant apps
- Close all chats apps

### Work
I usually need five to ten minutes to mess around because I know I won't have the deepest focus from the first minute. Because all distractions are blocked before, I can easily convince my brain to have a quick look at the task. I usually have a starting point with notes or next steps from the the previous session. I'll read through notes to myself and start loading the work context into my brain. This can include reading code, architecture, looking up similar solutions or alternative architectures. 

Once I gained some speed I set goals for the session to timebox the effort and to have a deadline to run towards. Maximum length of the session is usually 90minutes to 2hrs depending on an upcoming call, having to eat or forcing myself to rest and come back right after. In order to keep context and flow I write comments right where I need to work (in code editor, document, presentation, etc).

## That's it
I don't run all steps for each session. Of course it's easier to focus on days with a ton of sleep and clear tasks that have immediate impact. This more elaborate list is a reminder for my past and future self I can always get at least one deep work session done per day.
